An example of an enum to represent months:

```C++
enum class Month {
	Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec		
};

Month month {Month::Jul} // Creates an instance of Month called month which starts on jul
```

Under the hood, all of these values are represented as an integer.
* Jan(0)
* Feb(1)
* Mar(2)
* Apr(3)
* May(4)
* Jun(5)
* Jul(6)
* Aug(7)
* Sep(8)
* Oct(9)
* Nov(10)
* Dec(11)

You can also specify what values they start at.

```C++
enum class Month {
	Jan = 1, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug = 18, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec		
};
```

Now the values with be represented as:
* Jan(1)
* Feb(2)
* Mar(3)
* Apr(4)
* May(5)
* Jun(6)
* Jul(7)
* Aug(18)
* Sep(19)
* Oct(20)
* Nov(21)
* Dec(22)

You are also able to give multiple enumerators the same value.

```C++
enum class Month {
	Jan = 1, January = 1 Feb = 2, February = 2, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug = 18, August = 18, Sep = 19, September = Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec		
};
```

What is the size of the first Month Enum we created? Well if you check the sizeof(month) results, it will say 4 bytes because an enum is represented as an int by default.
