A constant variable can be initialized but can't be changed afterwards. If you do try to change after you assign it, you will get a compile error.
```C++
const unsigned int earthRadiusKM{6371};
```

Constexpr means it is a constant that be evaluate at compile time. It is beneficial to do this so that you can move heavy computations to compile time to prevent slowdown during run time.
