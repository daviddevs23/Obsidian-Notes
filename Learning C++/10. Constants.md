A constant variable can be initialized but can't be changed afterwards. If you do try to change after you assign it, you will get a compile error.
```C++
const unsigned int earthRadiusKM{6371};
```

Constexpr means it is a constant that be evaluate at compile time. It is beneficial to do this so that you can move heavy computations to compile time to prevent slowdown during run time.
```C++
constexpr int product(int x, int y) { return (x * y); }
int main() {
	constexpr int x = product(10, 20);
	std::cout << x;
	return 0; 
}
```
Realistically, you would not do something like this but instead do it with a much more complex and time consuming action. This is simply an example.
