## Literal
A literal is data that is directly represented in code without going though some other variable stored in data. You use literals to initialize variables. They are just literal numbers, strings, or bools that do not change.
```C++
int num{2};

std::cout << num + num << std::cout; // Variables
std::cout << 2 + 2 << std::cout; // Literals
```
