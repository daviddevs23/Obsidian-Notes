Converting from one datatype to another can lead to data being lost or malformed. Remember, all variables in an expression must be of the same type, or else the compiler will do an implicit conversion ie int + a float.

## Implicit Data Conversions
This is data that is converted for you by the compiler is an implicit conversion. Generally, you want to try to keep all datatypes the same in expressions but this is the real world, and that doesn't always happen. Implicit conversions will convert smaller data types to larger data types (size in memory size). So an expression with floats and ints will turn the ints into floats as floats are larger.
```C++
double price{45.6};
int units{10};

double totalPrice = price * unites; // This will convert the units variable to an int
```

## Explicit Data Conversions
Explicit data conversions are conversions actively initiated by you.
