## Print integers in binary
You can print integers in different formats using the bitset library.
```C++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int test{10};
  std::cout << std::dec << test << std::endl;      // Print as decimal
  std::cout << std::hex << test << std::endl;      // Print as hexadecimal
  std::cout << std::oct << test << std::endl;      // Print as octal
  std::cout << std::bitset<16>(test) << std::endl; // Print as binary
  return 0;
}
```

## Shift Operators
Allows you to shift all the bits of a variable to the left or to the right, allowing you to multiply or divide by two for each shift. Be careful, you can lose bits as a result of this though.
```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Shifts bits 1 to the right
  int test{10};
  test = test >> 1;
  std::cout << test << std::endl; // 5

  // Shift bits 3 to the left
  test = test << 3;
  std::cout << test << std::endl; // 40
  return 0;
}
```

## AND(&) OR(|) XOR(^) NOT(~)
These are operations similar to the earlier boolean operations, the only difference is that these work on a bit by bit level

| a   | b   | a&b | a\|b | ~a  | a^b |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0    | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1    | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1    | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1    | 0   | 0   |

## Compound Bitwise And Assignment Operators
This is similar to how compound assignment operators work but with bitwise operations. These examples would be >>=, <<=, |=, &=, and ^=.

## Masks
Masks are a way we can highlight or shadow bits in a byte. You essentially just create a "mask". This mask is a variable with the bits you want to focus on and you can then use bitwise operators to extract, check, toggle, disable, enable, or whatever else, bits.
