The lifetime of a variable refers to how long the variable is kept alive in memory before it is wiped out. It becomes alive when you declares it and it is killed/wiped out from memory eventually. Whether that be going out of scope, the program ends, etc.

## Storage Duration
We have three types of storage duration: local, static, dynamic. Local variables only exist in their function or scope. Static variables die when the program ends.

## Local Variables
Exist only within their scope.
```C++
#include <iostream>

void example() {
    int localVar = 10; // Local variable
    std::cout << "Local variable: " << localVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    example();
    // localVar is not accessible here, it only exists inside the example function
    return 0;
}
```

## Static Variables
A static variable lasts the entire program and they are only initialized once.
```C++
#include <iostream>

void staticExample() {
    static int staticVar = 0; // Static variable, initialized only once
    staticVar++;
    std::cout << "Static variable: " << staticVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    staticExample(); // Prints 1
    staticExample(); // Prints 2
    staticExample(); // Prints 3
    return 0;
}
```

## Dynamic Variables
Dynamic variables are created when the new, malloc, or similar keywords are used. They live on the heap so their scope is determined by where the pointer is used. You can also end a dynamic variable with keywords like delete or free.
```C++
#include <iostream>

void dynamicExample() {
    int* dynamicVar = new int(42); // Dynamically allocated variable
    std::cout << "Dynamic variable: " << *dynamicVar << std::endl;
    delete dynamicVar; // Free the memory
}

int main() {
    dynamicExample();
    return 0;
}
```

## Variable Scope
The scope of a variable refers to the region of code where the variable is accessible. There are several types  of scopes including block scope, function scope, file scope, and class scope.
```C++
#include <iostream>

int globalVar = 100; // Global scope (file scope)

void functionScopeExample() {
    int localVar = 50; // Local (function) scope
    std::cout << "Inside function: localVar = " << localVar << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Inside function: globalVar = " << globalVar << std::endl; // Global variable accessible
}

int main() {
    int blockVar = 25; // Block scope (inside main function)

    {
        // New block inside main
        int innerBlockVar = 10; // Block scope (limited to this block)
        std::cout << "Inside inner block: innerBlockVar = " << innerBlockVar << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Inside inner block: blockVar = " << blockVar << std::endl; // blockVar accessible
    }

    // innerBlockVar is not accessible here because it is limited to the inner block
    // std::cout << innerBlockVar; // This would cause an error

    std::cout << "Inside main: blockVar = " << blockVar << std::endl;

    functionScopeExample();

    return 0;
}
```
