## If Statements
The if statement allows you to do things conditionally. This just means that if the condition evaluates to be true, then you will run the conditional actions.
```C++
if (true) {
	// Do things
}

if (false) {
	// Don't do things
}
```
You can have conditional statements beyond just the true and false keywords. Anything that evaluates to true or false can be used. Here are some examples.

```C++
int x{5};

if (x == 5) {
	// Do things
}

if (x != 10) {
	// Do things
}

if (x > 3) {
	// Do things
}

if (x <= 5) {
	// Do things
}

bool isRaining{true};

if (isRaining) {
	// Do things
}

if (isRaining && x > 2) {
	// Do things
}

if (isRaining || x > 1000) {
	// Do things
}

bool chungus{false};

if (!chungus) {
	// sad
}

if (!chungus) {
	if (isRaining || x == 2) {
		// Do things and sad
	}
}
```
## Else If
Else and else if allow you to chain conditions together and have default causes.
```C++
int number{20};

if (number > 10) {
	cout << "Number is greater than 10." << endl;
} else if (number <= 10) {
	cout << "Number is less than or equal to 10." << endl;
} else {
	cout << "Number is less than 10." << endl;
}

// VS

number = 10;

if (number >= 10) {
	cout << "Number is greater than or equal to 10." << endl;
} 
if (number == 10) {
	cout << "Number is exactly 10." << endl;
}

return 0;
```

## Switch
Switches allows you to quickly and easily switch between blocks of code with minimal effort.
```C++
// This could be achieved with if statements
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
	case 1:
		std::cout << "Monday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 2:
		std::cout << "Tuesday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 3: // This will be the case that gets selected
		std::cout << "Wednesday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 4:
		std::cout << "Thursday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 5:
		std::cout << "Friday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 6:
		std::cout << "Saturday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 7:
		std::cout << "Sunday" << std::endl;
		break;
	default:
		std::cout << "Invalid day" << std::endl;
}
```

The break keyword allows you to break out of the switch statement after you have run the case dependent code you'd like to run. It can also be selectively removed to do cascading code statements. For example, when given the state of a robot arm, it can be used to then get to a final state dependent on its current state.

```C++
// This is something that if statements can't do
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
	case 1:
		std::cout << "Monday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 2:
		std::cout << "Tuesday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 3: // This will be the case that gets selected
		std::cout << "Wednesday" << std::endl;
		// No longer have a break here so Thursday will also be printed
	case 4:
		std::cout << "Thursday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 5:
		std::cout << "Friday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 6:
		std::cout << "Saturday" << std::endl;
		break;
	case 7:
		std::cout << "Sunday" << std::endl;
		break;
	default:
		std::cout << "Invalid day" << std::endl;
}
```
