## For Loops
The is self explanatory, here's a simple example.
``` C++
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
	// Do stuff
}
```

## Range Based For Loops
This lets you iterate through a collection of items really easily.
```C++
int bagOfValues[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

for (int value : bagOfValues) {
	std::cout << value << std::endl;
}
```

## While Loops
A loop executes a statement as long as the parameters evaluate to true.
```C++
int count{0};
int limit{100};

while (count < limit) {
	std::cout << count << std::endl;
	count++;
}
```

## Do While Loops
A loop that executes a statement and then checks if the parameters are true.
```C++
int count{0};
int limit{100};

do {
	std::cout << count << std::endl;
	count++;
} while (count < limit);
```

## Break And Continue
Break breaks out of the loop immediatly and causes the loop to stop executing immedietly.

Continue skips the rest of the current loop iteration and goes to the next iteration.
