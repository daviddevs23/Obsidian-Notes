## For Loops
The is self explanatory, here's a simple example.
``` C++
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
	// Do stuff
}
```

## Range Based For Loops
This lets you iterate through a collection of items really easily.
```C++
int bagOfValues[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

for (int value : bagOfValues) {
	std::cout << value << std::endl;
}
```

## While Loops
A loop executes a statement as long as the parameters evaluate to true.
```C++
int count{0};
int limit{100};

while (count < limit) {
	std::cout << count << std::endl;
	count++;
}
```
