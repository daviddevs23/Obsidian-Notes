## Declaring a Pointer
You can declare a point using the * character. 

```C++
int *pointerNumber{};
```

This is a variable that stores an address to a variable. It also means it can only store the address for an int value and nothing else. The size of a pointer of any type will all be the same on the same machine. This is because it is storing the address of a variable.
