## Declaring a Pointer
You can declare a point using the * character. 

```C++
int *pointerNumber{nullptr};

int value{17};

int *pointerToVal = &value;
pointerNumber = &value;
```

This is a variable that stores an address to a variable. It also means it can only store the address for an int value and nothing else. The size of a pointer of any type will all be the same on the same machine. This is because it is storing the address of a variable.
## Pointer To Char
Same as the previous example, just swap the type of int out with char.
```C++
char letter{'A'};

char *letterPointer = &letter;
```

## Arrays of Pointer to Char
