## Declaring a Pointer
You can declare a point using the * character. 

```C++
int *pointerNumber{nullptr};

int value{17};

int *pointerToVal = &value;
pointerNumber = &value;
```

This is a variable that stores an address to a variable. It also means it can only store the address for an int value and nothing else. The size of a pointer of any type will all be the same on the same machine. This is because it is storing the address of a variable.
## Pointer To Char
Same as the previous example, just swap the type of int out with char.
```C++
char letter{'A'};

char *letterPointer = &letter;
```

## Arrays of Pointer to Char
You are able to create and array of char pointers. This allows you to create a list of strings that automatically size themselves appropriately.
```C++
const char *predictions[] {
 "First String", "Second String", "Third String", "Bob", "Fifth String"
};

std::cout << predictions[3] << std::endl;
```
## Stack vs Heap
The stack is a region of memory used for static memory allocation. Used for things like storing local variables, function calls, and return addresses and is managed by the compiler. It is fast and managed automatically. Stored in a LIFO structure.

The Heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Is manually managed by the programmer with new/delete and malloc/free. It is slower but larger than the stack and can hold data that can outlive the scope.
## Dangling Pointers
A pointer that doesn't point to a valid memory address. Trying to use or reference that value can result in undefined behavior.
