A reference is an alias that refers to another variable. This allows you to use the reference in the same way you use the original variable. Here is an example:
```C++
int number{45};

int& refNumber{number};
```

## References VS Pointers
Here are some common similarities and differences between pointer and references.

References:
- Don't need to be dereferenced to read and write to them.
- Can't be changed to reference something else.
- Must be initialized at declaration.

Pointers:
- Must be dereferenced to read/write to them.
- Can be changed to point somewhere else.
- Can be NULL and uninitialized, pointed to garbage data.

## References and Const
A const reference keeps you from changing the referenced variable through the reference. Essentially, this creates a read only reference to a variable.
```C++
int age{30};
const int& refAge{age};

refAge = 12;    // Causes an error
```
