## Check if a Character is Alphanumeric
Tells you if a character is either a number or a letter.
```C++
std::isalnum('C');
```

## Check if a Character is Alphabetic
This just tells you if a character is a letter.
```C++
std::isalpha('C');
```


## Check if a Character is Blank
Tells you if a character is a blank character (space or tab).
```C++
std::isblank(' ');
```

## Check if a Character is Upper/Lower Case
Checks if the current character is upper or lower case.
```C++
std::islower('C');
std::isupper('C');
```

## Check if a Character is a Number
Checks if the current character is a number.
```C++
std::isdigit('C');
```

## Change Character to Uppercase/Lowercase
Converts back and forth between uppercase/lowercase.
```C++
std::tolower('C');
std::toupper('c');
```

## Get the Length of a C-String
```C++
char message[] = "Yeet";
std::strlen(message);
```

## Compare Two C-Strings
Returns negative if the first string appears first lexicographically, 0 if they are the same, and positive if the second is lexicographically first
```C++
char message[] = "Yeet";
char call[] = "Yeet";
std::strcmp(message, call);
```

You can also do this to compare the first n characters in two strings.
```C++
std::strncmp(string1, string2, n);
```

## Find First Occurrence of Char in C-String
```C++
std::strchr(string, target);
```

## Find Last Occurrence of Char in C-String
```C++
std::strrchr(string, target);
```

## Join Two C-Strings Together
```C++
std::strcat(dst, src);
```

You can also concatenate n number of chars from src to dest.
```C++
std::strncat(dst, src, n);
```

## Copying Strings
```C++
std::strcpy(dst, src);
```

You can also copy n characters
```C++
std::strncpy(dst, src, n);
```

## std::string is Much Better
```C++
#include <string>

std::string heck {"String as heck"};
```

## String Concatenation
You can use the + operator.
```C++
std::string string1 {"Hello "};
std::string string2 {"World!"};
std::string message = string1 + string2;
```

You can also use the append() method.
```C++
std::string string1 {"Hello "};
std::string string2 {"World!"};
string1.append(string2);
string1.append(string2, 4, 5); // appends a sub-section
string1.append(5, '!');        // appends 5 exclamation marks
```

You can also use these when adding a c-string to a string.
```C++
char message[] = "YEET";
std::string betterMessage = "Hello ";

std::string finalMessage = betterMessage + message;
// or
betterMessage.append(message);
```

## Add Number to String
```C++
std::string message = "Hello" + std::to_string(67);
```
