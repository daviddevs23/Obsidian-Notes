## Check if a Character is Alphanumeric
Tells you if a character is either a number or a letter.
```C++
std::isalnum('C');
```

## Check if a Character is Alphabetic
This just tells you if a character is a letter.
```C++
std::isalpha('C');
```


## Check if a Character is Blank
Tells you if a character is a blank character (space or tab).
```C++
std::isblank(' ');
```

## Check if a Character is Upper/Lower Case
Checks if the current character is upper or lower case.
```C++
std::islower('C');
std::isupper('C');
```

## Check if a Character is a Number
Checks if the current character is a number.
```C++
std::isdigit('C');
```

## Change Character to Uppercase/Lowercase
Converts back and forth between uppercase/lowercase.
```C++
std::tolower('C');
std::toupper('c');
```

## Get the Length of a C-String
```C++
char message[] = "Yeet";
std::strlen(message);
```

## Compare Two C-Strings
Returns negative if the first string appears first lexicographically, 0 if they are the same, and positive if the second is lexicographically first
```C++
char message[] = "Yeet";
char call[] = "Yeet";
std::strcmp(message, call);
```

You can also do this to compare the first n characters in two strings.
```C++
std::strncmp(string1, string2, n);
```

## Find First Occurrence of Char in C-String
```C++
std::strchr(string, target);
```

## Find Last Occurrence of Char in C-String
```C++
std::strrchr(string, target);
```

## Join Two C-Strings Together
```C++
std::strcat(dst, src);
```

You can also concatenate n number of chars from src to dest.
```C++
std::strncat(dst, src, n);
```

## Copying Strings
```C++
std::strcpy(dst, src);
```

You can also copy n characters
```C++
std::strncpy(dst, src, n);
```

## std::string is Much Better
```C++
#include <string>

std::string heck {"String as heck"};
```

## String Concatenation
You can use the + operator.
```C++
std::string string1 {"Hello "};
std::string string2 {"World!"};
std::string message = string1 + string2;
```

You can also use the append() method.
```C++
std::string string1 {"Hello "};
std::string string2 {"World!"};
string1.append(string2);
string1.append(string2, 4, 5); // appends a sub-section
string1.append(5, '!');        // appends 5 exclamation marks
```

You can also use these when adding a c-string to a string.
```C++
char message[] = "YEET";
std::string betterMessage = "Hello ";

std::string finalMessage = betterMessage + message;
// or
betterMessage.append(message);
```

## Add Number to String
```C++
std::string message = "Hello" + std::to_string(67);
```

## Accessing Characters in Strings
```C++
std::string str {"THIS IS A TEST STRING"};

for (size_t i{}; i < str.size(); i++) {
	std::cout << " " << str[i];
	std::cout << " " << str.at(i); // Can also do this
}

// Can also get a copy of the first and last character
char firstChar = str.front();
char lastChar = str.back();
```

## Modifying Characters in Strings
```C++
std::string str {"THIS IS A TEST STRING"};

str[1] = 'A';
str.at(1) = 'A';
```

## Get C-String from String
```C++
std::string str{"String"};
char cStr[] = str.c_str();
```

You can also get a pointer to the underlying data to modify the string
```C++
char * ptrStr = str.data();
```

## Size and Capacity of a String
Check to see if a string is empty.
```C++
std::string test{};
test.empty();
```

Get the length of a string.
```C++
std::string test2{"I am a string"};
test2.size();
// or
test2.length();
```

Get the max number of characters the string can have on your system.
```C++
std::string test3{"Hello"};
test3.max_size();
```

Get the current capacity of a string. This just means getting the remaining space that the string has allocated. If you add more characters than are allocated, the string will automatically allocate more characters for it.
```C++
std::string test4{"Another One"};
test4.capacity();
```

Manually expand the capacity of a string.
```C++
std::string test5{"MORE BIGGER"};
test5.reserve(100);
```

Reduce capacity to the current size of the string.
```C++
std::string test6{"SHRINK MORE GOODER"};
test6.shrink_to_fit();
```

## Modifying Strings
Remove all characters from a string.
```C++
std::string test1{"Hello"};
test1.clear();
```

Insert characters at an index.
```C++
std::string test2{"YET"};
test2.insert(1, 1, 'E');

char* chars{" THAT"};
test2.insert(3, chars);

std::string test3{"SDfSDF"};
test2.uinsert(4, test3);
```

Erase characters from a string.
```C++
std::string test4{"aasdfasdf"};
test4.erase(3);
test4.erase(1, 4);
```

Add and removes characters to/from the end of a string.
```C++
std::string test5{"12345"};
test5.push_back(`6`);
test5.pop_back();
```

## Comparing Strings
Two strings are considered equal if they are the same length and have the same characters in every position. Comparisons are carried out lexicographically by default. You can also carry out the following operations between a string and a c-string.
```C++
std::string test1{"abc"};
std::string test2{"def"};

test1 == test2;
test1 != test2;
test1 > test2;
test1 >= test2;
test1 < test2;
test1 <= test2;
```

There is also a dedicated compare method for strings. If you get a negative value back, the first string is greater. If you get a positive value, the second strings is greater and 0 if they are equal.
```C++
std::string test3{"abc"};
std::string test4{"def"};

test3.compare(test4);
```

## Replacing, Copying, Resizing, and Swapping
You can replace sections of your string with other strings.
```C++
std::string test1{"as;ldkjf;alsdfjkasf"};
std::string test2{"sasdf"};

test1.replace(0,3, test2);
```

You can also copy a portion of a string into a c-string.
```C++
std::string test3{"as;ldkjf;alsdfjkasf"};
char test4[14]{};

test3.copy(test4,3, 0);
```

You can also size up a string where any new characters are filled in with the null character ('\0'). You can also specify a character to auto fill the new space with or just size down as well. When resizing down, extra characters will be cut off.
```C++
std::string test5{"I'm A String"};

test5.resize(30);
test5.resize(1000, 'f');
test5.resize(1);
```

If you have two strings and want to swap their values, you can do it with the swap command.
```C++
std::string test6{"I AM 6"};
std::string test7{"I AM 7"};

test7.swap(test6);
```

## Searching Strings
You find a string in another string and it returns std::string::npos if it is not found. You can also include a starting position.
```C++
std::string test1{"I AM STRING"};
std:;string test2{"AM"};

size_t foundPos = test1.find(test2);
size_t foundPos2 = test1.find(test2, 4);
```

## Transforming Strings To/From Numbers
You can convert numbers (flouts, doubles, and ints) to strings.
```C++
float num1{1.1f};
double num2{1.11};
int num3{1};

std::to_string(num1);
std::to_string(num2);
std::to_string(num3);
```

You can also do the inverse.
```C++
int num = std::stoi("1")
float num2 = std::stof("1.1")
double num3 = std::stod("2.2")
```

## Escape Sequences
You know this stuff, just use a \ to escape characters in strings, it's not that deep.

## Raw String Literals
Raw string literals allows you to create strings without all the escape sequences in them. You create them by prepend a capital R to the string.
```C++
std::string RAWSTRING { R"(
CLEAN THE HOUSE
WALK THE DOG
BANANA PHONE
)" }
```

## std::string_view
A string view allows you to save memory by creating a "view" of the string instead of copying it. Similar to how a pointer works. You can use it exactly like a normal string. If you change the original string, the string_view reflects it. If you change a string_view, you do not modify the original string.
```C++
std::string test1{"as;dfkjasd"};
std::string_view test2{test1};
```
