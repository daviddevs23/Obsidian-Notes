R```C++
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
```

Argc tells you how many arguments were passed to your function and argv is a 2d array of parameters. If nothing is passed to the function, argc will be 1. If you you pass one parameter, argc will be 2. This is because it counts the call to the executable as an argument.

```bash
./main #argc is 1
./main first second #argc is 3
```

If you want to access argv, simply treat it as an array of strings and index them. Here is a simple example that prints out all of the given paramters.

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    std::cout << argv[i] << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Here is some example output:

```bash
-> ./main first second

./main
first
second
```
