## Input and Output Parameters

Here we use references so whatever value is passed as output will be changed, essentially returning a value without actually returning a value. The input variables are marked as const as they are not meant to be changed. This is a general rule of thumb as you want to keep input values the same generally.

```C++
void max_str(const std::string& input1, const std::string& input2, std::string& output){
	if (input1 > input2) {
		output = input1;
	} else {
		output = input2
	}
}
```
