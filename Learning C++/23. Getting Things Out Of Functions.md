## Input and Output Parameters
Here we use references so whatever value is passed as output will be changed, essentially returning a value without actually returning a value. The input variables are marked as const as they are not meant to be changed. This is a general rule of thumb as you want to keep input values the same when you pass them by reference.

```C++
void max_str(const std::string& input1, const std::string& input2, std::string& output){
	if (input1 > input2) {
		output = input1;
	} else {
		output = input2
	}
}
```

## Returning from Functions (by value)
We will now look at using the **return** keyword. Here is a simple example. Note we did not have to make the inputs **const** as they are being passed by value and reference.

```C++
int sum (int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

## Returning from Functions (by reference)
In order to return by reference, you simply add and & to the return type of a function. Returning by reference is really useful if you want to get a reference to the location in memory to cause change in the larger of the two variables.

```C++
int& max_return_reference(int& a, int&b) {
	if (a > b) {
		return a;
	} else {
		return b;
	}
}

int main() {
	int a = 12;
	int b = 40;

	int& result = max_return_reference(a, b);

	// Makes it so be (max value) is now 120
	result = 120;

	return 0;
}
```

## Returning from Functions (by pointer)
Similar to the previous examples, but we convert the return type into a pointer.

```C++
int* max_return_pointer(int* a, int*b) {
	if (*a > *b) {
		return a;
	} else {
		return b;
	}
}

int main() {
	int a = 10;
	int b = 12;
	
	int *result = max_return_pointer(&a, &b);

	// The value of b (max value) is now 1000
	*result = 1000;
	
	return 0;
}

```

## Return Array Element Address By Pointer
Create a simple function that returns the pointer the maximum value in the array. Here we have it set so that the values are immutable with the const keyword, so we don't want anything to be changed. If you want values to be mutable, remove the const keyword.

```C++
#include <iostream>

const double *find_max_address(const double scores[], size_t count) {
    size_t max_index{};
    double max{};

    for (size_t i{0}; i < count; i++) {
        if (scores[i] > max) {
            max = scores[i];
            max_index = i;
        }
    }
    return &scores[max_index];
}

int main() {
      double scores[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
      size_t count = 9;

      const double *result = find_max_address(scores, count);

      std::cout << result << std::endl;
      std::cout << *result << std::endl;

      return 0;
}

```
