## Input and Output Parameters
Here we use references so whatever value is passed as output will be changed, essentially returning a value without actually returning a value. The input variables are marked as const as they are not meant to be changed. This is a general rule of thumb as you want to keep input values the same when you pass them by reference.

```C++
void max_str(const std::string& input1, const std::string& input2, std::string& output){
	if (input1 > input2) {
		output = input1;
	} else {
		output = input2
	}
}
```

## Returning from Functions (by value)
We will now look at using the **return** keyword. Here is a simple example. Note we did not have to make the inputs **const** as they are being passed by value and reference.

```C++
int sum (int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

## Returning from Functions (by reference)
In order to return by reference, you simply add and & to the return type of a function. 

```C++
int& max_return_reference(int& a, int&b) {
	if (a > b) {
		return a;
	} else {
		return b;
	}
}
```
