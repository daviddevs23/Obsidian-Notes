Function overloading allows you to define functions with the same name but different parameters. At compile time, the compiler will pick the implementation that fits the best. Note, this overloading only works on parameters and the return type can't be used to differentiate overloaded functions.
```C++
int max(int a, int b);
double max(double a, double b);
std::string max(std::string a, std::string b);
```

## Overloading with Default Parameters
You can get a compiler error that says you function call is ambiguous in certain cases where you use default parameters. The following example confuses the compiler as it does not know which version of the function to use.
```C++
void print_age(int age = 33);
void print_age(long int age = 44);

print_age();
```
