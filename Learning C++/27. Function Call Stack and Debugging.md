## Function Stack
The function call stack is a stack data structure that follows the LIFO (last in first out) principle. When you run a function, you start by adding the main function to the stack. When the main function calls another function, it is added to the stack, and then popped from the top of the stack when it is finished running.

## Debugging
A debugger is just another program you use to run your code with. It allows you to start and stop the program at will to inspect data at a given point during execution. A really good one for C++ is gdb.
