Function templates are a tool in C++ that are provided to prevent excessive code repetition. For example, let's say you want a function that can take any input. Using function overloading you would have to replicate the code with different definitions many times. Using function templates, you would just do the following:
```C++
template <typename T>

T maximum( T a, T b){
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}
```

Function templates are not real C++ code, they are just blueprints. The compiler will generate real C++ code by look at the arguments you call your function template with. Pretty much just auto makes the overloads for you.

## Explicit Arguments
In case you want to tell the compiler what version of the function you want called, you can specify a type.
```C++
maximum<double>(a,b);
```
