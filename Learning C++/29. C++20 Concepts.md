Concepts are a mechanism to place constraints on template type parameters. When these constraints are violated, it will cause errors. A list of of Core Language Concepts:

| Defined In Header        | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| same_as                  | specifies that a type is the same as another type                                                 |
| derived_from             | specifies that a type is derived from another type                                                |
| convertible_to           | specifies that a type is implicitly convertible to another type                                   |
| common_reference_with    | specifies that two types share a common reference type                                            |
| common_with              | specifies that two types share a common type                                                      |
| integral                 | specifies that a type is an integral type                                                         |
| signed_integral          | specifies that a type is an integral type that is signed                                          |
| unsigned_integral        | specifies that a type is an integral type that is unsigned                                        |
| floating_point           | specifies that a type is a floating-point type                                                    |
| assignable_from          | specifies that a type is assignable from another type                                             |
| swappable/swappable_with | specifies that a type can be swapped or that two types can be swapped with each other             |
| destructible             | specifies that an object of the type can be destroyed                                             |
| constructible_from       | specifies that a variable of the type can be constructed from or bound to a set of argument types |
| default_initializable    | specifies that an object of a type can be default constructed                                     |
| move_constructible       | specifies that an object of a type can be move constructed                                        |
| copy_constructible       | specifies that an object of a type can be copy constructed and move constructed                   |

An example of concepts:
```C++
template <typename T>
requires std::integral<T> // Specifies that T must be integral
T add(T a, T b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

or 

```C++
template <std::integral T>
T add(T a, T b) {
	return a + b;
}
```
