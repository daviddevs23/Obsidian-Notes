Classes are user defined data types that serve as a collection of data and functions. Think of them as blueprints for encapsulation data and functions.

Here is an example of a C++ class for a cylinder:
```C++
class Cylinder {
public:
	double baseRadius {1.0};
	double height {1.0};

public:
	double volume() {
		return PI * baseRadius * baseRadius * height;
	}
};
```

This is how you would use it:
```C++
Cylinder cylinder1;
std::cout << "Volume is: " << cylinder1.volume() << std::endl;
```

## Constructors
Constructors are a special type of class method that is called when your class is created. It has no return type, has the same name as the class, can have parameters and is usually used to initialize member variables of a class. Here is an example with two constructors, one which takes a height and radius, and the other which sets default values. I will also make the member variable private so they can't be changed:
```C++
class Cylinder {
private:
	double baseRadius {1.0};
	double height {1.0};

public:
	Cylinder(){
		baseRadius = 2.0;
		height = 2.0;
	};
	
	Cylinder(double radiusParam, double heightParam){
		baseRadius = radiusParam;
		height = heightParam;
	};
	
	double volume() {
		return PI * baseRadius * baseRadius * height;
	};
};
```
