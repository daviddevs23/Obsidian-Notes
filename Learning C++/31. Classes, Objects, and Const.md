When you create an instance of a class with the const keyword, you will be locked out of it. You won't be able to modify or read from them at all.

```C++
const Dog dog1("Fido", "Shepherd", 3);
```

In order to get around this, we need to tell the compiler that some member functions will never modify the object. That way when we create a const instance of an object, we can still read the data while maintaining the lock that prevents the object from being modified. You can do this by appending the const keyword to a member function that does not modify the object.
```C++
std::string getName() const { // Append const
	return dogName;
}

std::string getBreed() const { // Append const
	return dogBreed;
}
```

Now I can use these functions, even if the instance of the object is marked as static.

You can also overload functions based on whether the object is const or not.
```C++
// Called when const
std::string getBreed() const { // Append const
	return dogBreed;
}

// Called when not const, can modify data
std::string getBreed() {
	printCount++;
	return dogBreed;
}
```
