## Variables
Variables allow you to store data. Examples:
```C++
int age = 20;
double weight = 1.2;
char grade = 'a';
```

It is best to initialize data or else trash will be there. Here is how you initialize to 0 or the equivalent in 0 for a few data types.
```C++
int age{};
double weight{};
char grade{};

// or

int age{10};
double weight{1.2};
char grade{'a'};
```

## Integers
Integers are used to store whole numbers and take up 4 bytes. Good for storing things that aren't fractional. Things like the number of people in a room or the number of robots on the field.
