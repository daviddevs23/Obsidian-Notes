## Variables
Variables allow you to store data. Examples:
```C++
int age = 20;
double weight = 1.2;
char grade = 'a';
```

It is best to initialize data or else trash will be there. Here is how you initialize to 0 or the equivalent in 0 for a few data types.
```C++
int age{};
double weight{};
char grade{};

// or

int age{10};
double weight{1.2};
char grade{'a'};
```

## Integers
Integers are used to store whole numbers and take up 4 bytes. Good for storing things that aren't fractional. Things like the number of people in a room or the number of robots on the field.

```C++
int population{20};
int numRobots{100};
int willToLive{-100000}
```

## Integer Modifiers
The default is signed, it allows you to have positive or negative numbers. The max and min of a signed int is 2147483647 and -2147483648 (INT_MAX). Unsigned makes it so you can only hold positive numbers. The max and min of an unsigned integer is 4294967295 and 0 (UINT_MAX).
```C++
int test1{100};
signed int test2{100};

unsigned int test3{100};

unsigned int test4{-10}; // error
```

## Short and Long Ints
Short ints have a max and min value of 32767 and -32768. Long ints have a max and min value of 9223372036854775807 and -9223372036854775808.
```C++
short int shorty{12};
long int longy{12000};
```
